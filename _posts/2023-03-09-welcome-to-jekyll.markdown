# Intro
Hello, my name is Zzwip and I joined Warmane - Lordaeron on 23rd of February 2018.
I played on that server for a bit less than 4 years as I stopped in December 2021.
My rogue was my very first character on Lordaeron and I have been playing it since then with some breaks here and there. It is the class and spec I have the most experience with PvE wise and it is for those reasons that I feel like I have the expertise to maybe teach you one or two things about the WotLK Combat Rogue.

I do not claim to be the best Rogue of the server, far from it, I am always looking to improve and learn and it sometimes happens to me, even after 3 years, to learn or discover something I didn’t know about Combat Rogue.
If you go through all this guide and you see something you disagree with or think I could do better, I invite you to let me know about it under this post or directly on Discord.

If you already know that Rogue is your class and that you wanna play Combat spec for PvE, I will advise you skip the Generalities section.

If you already play Rogue for quite some time now and you just wanna see if you could learn some tips & tricks you didn’t know about, I will advise you to go directly to the Abilities / Rotation / Priorities and Encounters sections.
